#Chapter 12: Survival Analysis

Survival function measures how likely it is for somethign to be alive at a moment. It is really 1 - cumulative distribution function

Hazard function (or force mortality) gives probability of dying with time interval t, given subject is alive at time t

```{r}
library(survival)
```

Routines in survival package work with Surf objects, which contain timing and censoring information

```{r}
data(melanom)
attach(melanom)
names(melanom)
```

Status: 1 means dead, 2 means alive on Jan 1 1978, 3 means dead from other causes. Create survival object in which 2 and 3 are treated as censorings.

```{r}
Surv(days, status == 1)
```

survfit(Surv(days, status == 1))
